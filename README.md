# EE10115_TempRegulator_Project (04/20/2022)
   This Arduino program contains the code for a temperature regulator 
   which checks the current ambient temperature and adjusts 
   the speed of a DC fan accordingly. 
   It has two modes: Manual (user sets fan speed) 
   and Automatic (user sets desired temperature).
   
   Microcontroller Board: Arduino Uno
   
   Sensors:
   - Thermistor (temperature sensor) 
   - Potentiometer
   - Push Button

   Actuators: 
   - 120mm 4-pin PWM RGB Fan (12V DC motor) 
   - 16x2 LCD
